# Overview

:::note
The Blueprint SDK is currently on development and not all the features are available yet.
:::

The Blueprint SDK provides methods in TypeScript, for developing on or interacting with ZK Email Blueprints.

Using the SDK you can:

- **Generate proofs from emails**. Generate proofs from emails using the ZK Email Blueprint of your choice.
- **Create custom blueprints**. Create your own ZK Email Blueprints to verify custom patterns in emails.
- **Verify proofs onchain**. Verify proofs onchain using the ZK Email Verifier smart contract.
